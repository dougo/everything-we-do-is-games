Everything We Do Is Games
=========================

A null game, inspired by John Cage's 4′33″ for [ShuffleComp Disc 2](http://www.nigeljayne.ca/shufflecomp2015.html).
See statement.html in the "Everything We Do Is Games.materials" directory for the author's statement.

To compile, load the "Everything We Do Is Games.inform" directory in the [Inform 7](http://inform7.com/) IDE and
press the play button. Press the release button to generate a zblorb and a website in the "Everything We Do Is
Games.materials/Release" directory.

Note that due to a bug, this game does not compile in Inform 7 release 6L38. I recommend using release 6L02.

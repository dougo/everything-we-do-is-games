    <h2><center>Author Statement</center></h2>

    <p>John Cage said "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWowppCYTZ0">Everything we do is music.</a>"
      His 1952 composition
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3"><cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite></a> is popularly
      thought to consist of silence, but his intent was to show that there <em>is</em> no silence, practically
      speaking:

      <blockquote>You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops
        began pattering the roof, and during the third the people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds
        as they talked or walked out.</blockquote>

    <p><a href="."><cite>Everything We Do Is Games</cite></a> is my attempt to show that even a null interactive
      fiction game is a game. Many have pointed out that all fiction is interactive, to some extent: the reader
      chooses whether and when to turn the page, as
      in <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=3l73pkt3g127dqf6">Jesse McGrew's <cite>Moby Dick; or, The
      Whale</cite></a>, or <a href="http://smollin.com/michael/tmonstr/mon001.html">Jon Stone's <cite>The Monster
      at the end of this Book</cite></a>. Moreover, the reader's mind interacts with the fiction, choosing to
      create mental images and associations not literally present in the text but prompted by it, intentionally or
      not. The reading experience might even involve solving puzzles (such as murder mysteries). The experience of
      playing <cite>Everything We Do Is Games</cite> may involve confusion or surprise, as the player is confronted
      with a screen that says nothing but "<tt>[Hit any key to exit.]</tt>", or a brief "Parchment is loading."
      popup. After some consideration, and perhaps some experimentation such as reloading the game or trying a
      different interpreter, the player may come to understand that the game is in fact a null game; this state of
      satisfaction and enlightenment can be considered the winning (and only) ending.

    <p>You may grant that a null interactive fiction game is a game, and interactive, but is it fiction? In fact,
      it's both fiction and non-fiction: perhaps it is a simulation of what it's like to be a zombie, or an
      inventory of the contents of a geometric point, or a story of the events before the creation of the universe,
      or a tutorial for how to beat your heart. Ultimately, it's an instance of communication of an idea or set of
      ideas, wordlessly, just like all music and games.

    <p>The name of <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite> comes from the total length of the first performance of the
      piece, but the piece itself does not prescribe a length: the score (pictured in <a href="Cover.png">the cover
      art for <cite>Everything We Do Is Games</cite></a>) consists of three movements, each consisting of the word
      <strong>TACET</strong> (Latin for "it is silent"), a musical instruction to refrain from playing an
      instrument. The performer is free to choose the duration of each movement, although Cage's original idea was
      for the piece to be "three or four-and-a-half minutes long&mdash;those being the standard lengths of 'canned'
      music", so that it could be sold to Muzak Co. I considered adding a timer to the game, so that it would last
      either 4:33 or 2 hours (the <a href="http://www.ifcomp.org/rules/">prescribed maximum length of an IFComp
      game</a>), but I decided that would actually make it <em>less</em> interactive than Cage's piece!  Instead,
      like a performer of <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite>, the player can choose any length of time to play the
      game, until hitting any key or navigating away from the browser page. (One might also consider a playthrough
      of <cite>Everything We Do Is Games</cite> to itself <em>be</em> a performance
      of <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite>. It's also the soundtrack to the game.)

    <p>While <cite>Everything We Do Is Games</cite> is a null <em>game</em>, it is not a null <em>program</em>,
      just as the score for <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite> is not a blank page. In particular, the game consists of
      three <em>scenes</em>, an <a href="http://inform7.com/">Inform 7</a> concept to organize the turns of a
      game. The scenes correspond to the three movements of <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite>, and each scene consists
      of zero turns. Unfortunately, these scenes are not perceptible to the player the way that the movements are
      usually perceptible to the audience of a performance of <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite>: traditionally, a
      performer will close the keyboard lid of a piano at the beginning of each movement, and open it at the
      end. In this aspect, the role of performer is played by the interpreter program (i.e., the computer) rather
      than the player: of course, computers tend to have a much shorter attention span than players, and they will
      choose to perform each scene for only a millisecond or so.

    <p>In addition to defining the three scenes, <a href="source.html">the game's source program</a> includes
      several statements to inhibit things that Inform 7 prints by default. These took some work to figure out, and
      in fact I was not able to eliminate one blank line that Inform 7 games print at startup. This is possible to
      do, by replacing the main routine with custom Inform 6 code, but at that point I might as well have just
      implemented the game in <a href="http://inform-fiction.org/">Inform 6</a>, in which a null game can be
      written simply as <code>[Main;];</code>. I chose to use Inform 7, the current state-of-the-art tool for
      authoring interactive fiction, in part to demonstrate how much machinery is involved with creating a typical
      game: the generated Inform 6 source code is 54,000 lines, and the output Z-code file is over 300k, because
      they include the entire parser and world model library that most non-null games rely on. This is analogous to
      arranging an entire symphony orchestra in a concert hall to perform <cite>4&prime;33&Prime;</cite>,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY7UK-6aaNA">as was done in 2004 in London</a>.

    <p><a href="http://nickm.com/trope_tank/TROPE-13-03.pdf">As Nick Montfort points out</a>, unlike the empty set
      of mathematics and the null string of computer science, there is no single null program, but an abundance of
      null programs. This is even more true about null games: not only are there countless ways to write a null
      interactive fiction, and numerous IF implementation platforms, but there are a vast plethora of other game
      genres, each with its own community of practice and authoring tools. I encourage all reading this to create
      their own null games in their favorite genres, and consider how their frames influence the experience of
      playing the games. I also invite the reader to reflect on what it means to play a game, even beyond the
      boundaries of traditionally defined game structures: what exactly are games, anyway? I believe that, on
      multiple levels, everything we do is games.
